<h2>Joshua Wong</h2>
I am a software engineer at Amazon, part of the machine learning teams in Alexa where I focus on the extraction of facts from unstructured and semi-structured data. I also teach Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence as a supervisor in the Computer Science department at the University of Cambridge.
